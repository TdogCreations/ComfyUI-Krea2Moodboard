# ComfyUI-Krea2Moodboard

krea.ai-style **moodboard / vibe transfer** and **identity-preserving editing** for the open
**Krea 2** model, as ComfyUI nodes. Companion to the
[Forge Neo version](https://github.com/TdogCreations/forge-neo-krea2-toolkit) — same algorithms, same knobs.

## Nodes

### Krea 2 Moodboard
One-node vibe transfer: prompt + reference image(s) in, conditioning out (replaces `CLIPTextEncode`
on the positive). Knobs:

- **strength** — 1.0 = raw reference detail (layout/pose can leak); lower = purer extract. This is an
  *information* knob, not a multiplier (per-token RMSNorms erase plain scaling).
- **extract** — `style`: palette/lighting/texture/mood survive, subjects fade (spans collapse toward a
  mean/±std statistics signature). `subject`: statistics are whitened away, subject/composition
  survives and your prompt controls the look.
- **reference_processing** — full / 2×2 crops / 4×4 tiles (tiles: subjects are largely never encoded —
  strongest style-only setting).
- **indirect** — reference tokens are deleted after the text encoder ran: the DiT never sees them,
  style arrives only through prompt re-contextualization. Cannot copy poses; also the safe mode for
  crops/multi-ref (deleted spans cannot grid).
- **style_directive** — declarative "style from the refs, subjects from the text" sentence
  (auto-matches the extract mode).

### Krea 2 Moodboard Encode (packed)
The multi-reference specialist: all references (or crops) are packed into **ONE vision span** —
structurally grid-safe, references blend into a joint vibe. Same knobs. Use it standalone (with a
prompt) or as the **`fuse_with` feeder** for the identity node (empty prompt, `indirect` OFF —
fuse_with concatenates a separate encode, so deleted rows would carry no image influence).

### Krea 2 Moodboard + Identity Fusion
The recommended way to combine style refs with an identity edit: **one node, one encode** — the
instruction and the edit grounding attend the moodboard span inside the encoder, so `indirect`
(default ON) genuinely works: moodboard rows are deleted after encoding, people in your style refs
cannot appear in the output, and the style still transfers. Wire it as the KSampler positive
(connect `vae`!), keep the negative a Krea 2 Identity Edit with an empty prompt + the same source.
Both image inputs are **optional**: connect only `edit_source` for a plain identity edit, only
`moodboard_images` for plain vibe transfer, both for fusion — one node covers all three modes.

### Krea 2 Identity Edit
Instruction-based identity-preserving editing with community **krea2_edit LoRAs**
([krea2_identity_edit_v1](https://civitai.com/models/2761113)): *"create a photo of this person at a
night market"* — same face, same outfit, relit. Dual conditioning: clean source latents ride
in-context at RoPE frames 1..N (the LoRA's preserve-this signal) + the instruction is grounded on the
source through Qwen3-VL. `grounding_px` = likeness↔obedience dial (768 balanced, 1024+ for people).

- Use **two** of these: positive (instruction) + negative (**empty prompt, same image**) — the
  training unconditional, needed for CFG > 1 recipes.
- **`fuse_with`** input: feed a Moodboard Encode conditioning to fuse style-from-moodboard with
  identity-from-source. Fuse the POSITIVE only (style in the negative cancels under CFG).
- Two-ref (experimental upstream): scene in `image`, subject in `image2`.

### Krea2 Edit Source Chain
Chainable multi-reference input: each node appends one image; connect chains into the `sources`
input on Identity Edit or the Fusion node (frames 3..N after `image`/`image2`). Unlimited by the
architecture — but the edit LoRA trained on 1–2 references, so 3+ tends to blend identities (the
LoRA author's multi-person recipe is chaining *edit passes* instead: place person A, then run a
second edit adding person B from their reference).

## Example workflows (`workflows/`)

- `krea2_moodboard_t2i.json` — basic vibe transfer text-to-image
- `krea2_identity_edit_fusion.json` — identity edit + moodboard style fusion

### Full pipeline: `Krea_Workflow_Public.json` (advanced)

The author's complete daily-driver workflow: JoyCaption auto-captioning of scene/subject references,
wildcard prompting, identity edit + moodboard fusion, AR handling, optional upscale pass, group
bypass switches. Requires these custom node packs (all installable via ComfyUI-Manager):

| Pack | Used for |
|---|---|
| rgthree-comfy | switches, group bypassers, Power Lora Loader |
| ComfyUI-mxToolkit | sliders |
| ComfyUI-Impact-Pack | wildcard processor |
| ComfyUI-KJNodes | Set/Get nodes |
| ComfyUI_Comfyroll_CustomNodes | prompt combine, aspect ratio, text replace |
| ComfyUI-JoyCaption | image -> prompt captioning (downloads its captioner model on first run) |
| ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts (pythongosssss) | text display |
| comfyui-ollama-describer | text transformer node |
| ComfyUI-Image-Saver | sampler selector |
| comfyui_layerstyle | seed node |
| ComfyUI-WhiteRabbit | batch Lanczos resize |
| Derfuu_ComfyUI_ModdedNodes | text box |

The two lean example workflows above need NONE of these — core nodes + this pack only.

Settings baked in: ModelSamplingAuraFlow shift 1.15, Euler/Simple, Turbo 8 steps CFG 1 (removals:
Raw checkpoint, 20–40 steps, CFG 3). Match the output AR to the source; generate ≤2MP.

## Requirements

- ComfyUI with native Krea 2 support; **qwen3vl_4b** text encoder (vision weights) via CLIPLoader
  type `krea2`; `qwen_image_vae`.
- For editing: a krea2_edit LoRA at strength 1.0 (LoraLoaderModelOnly).

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/TdogCreations/ComfyUI-Krea2Moodboard ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Krea2Moodboard
```

## How it works / credits

Small additive patches at import: packed list-spans in Qwen3-VL preprocessing, moodboard effects
inside Krea 2's `encode_token_weights`, and the in-context ref-latents branch on the Krea 2 DiT
(`reference_latents` conditioning contract, like QwenImage/Flux edit models). All paths are
bit-identical to stock when the nodes aren't used.
